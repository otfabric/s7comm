// Package client provides an S7 protocol client for connecting to Siemens PLCs,
// reading and writing memory areas, and probing rack/slot and discovery.
//
// Outcome models: Strict (Connect, Close, WriteArea, WriteDB, UploadBlock, GetCPUState, GetProtectionLevel)
// return error on failure. Structured (ReadArea, ReadDB, etc.)—validation as error; remote outcomes in
// ReadResult.Status; use result.Err() for flow. Best-effort (Identify, GetBlockInfo, ListAllBlocks, ReadDiagBuffer)
// may return partial result with non-nil error.
//
// # Connection and “connected” state
//
// The client is “connected” after Connect() returns nil. Then the client holds
// an active TCP + COTP + S7 setup session. ReadArea, WriteArea, Identify, and
// other operations require the client to be connected; otherwise they return
// ErrNotConnected. A second Connect() replaces the session only after the new handshake succeeds. Use Close() to disconnect.
//
// # Read outcomes and “success”
//
// For reads, prefer: if err != nil { return err }; if err := res.Err(); err != nil { return err }; then use res.Data.
// Status is the canonical outcome; Err() is the convenience adapter; Message is descriptive only. ReadStatus values:
//
//   - success: returned length equals requested.
//   - short-read: 0 < returned < requested.
//   - empty-read: requested > 0 but returned 0.
//   - rejected: target returned an S7 error/return code.
//   - timeout: context or network timeout.
//   - transport-error: connection or send/receive failure.
//   - protocol-error: TPKT/COTP/S7 parse or length error.
//   - inconclusive: repeated reads gave mixed results (e.g. range probe).
//
// # Probe statuses (rack/slot probing)
//
// ProbeRackSlots returns candidates with ProbeStatus:
//
//   - unreachable: TCP connect failed.
//   - tcp-only: TCP ok, COTP failed.
//   - cotp-only: COTP ok, S7 setup failed.
//   - setup-only: S7 setup ok, no follow-up (non-strict mode).
//   - valid-connect: Setup ok, follow-up query failed or not run.
//   - valid-query: Setup ok and a follow-up SZL/query succeeded (strict mode).
//   - rejected: target returned S7 error.
//   - timeout: any stage timed out.
//   - flaky: retries gave mixed results.
//
// In non-strict mode, “valid” means setup-only or valid-connect. In strict
// mode, only valid-query is considered valid.
//
// # Best-effort and heuristic behavior
//
// Identify, GetBlockInfo, ListAllBlocks, and ReadDiagBuffer are best-effort and may return
// partial data with a non-nil error. Use result.Status and errors to distinguish full
// success from partial or best-effort results. Serialization (e.g. JSON) of result types
// is the responsibility of the caller; this package does not define wire or format contracts.
//
// # Errors and sentinels
//
// Stable and documented: ErrNotConnected, ErrRequestExceedsPDU, PDURefMismatchError,
// ValidationError, ReadStatus values. Use errors.As(err, &ValidationError{}) for
// caller-input validation; errors.As(err, *PDURefMismatchError) for response correlation.
// ErrProtocolFailure is advanced/diagnostic (malformed protocol framing); handshake and
// request path wrap it for classification. Returned errors may wrap multiple underlying
// errors; use errors.Is and errors.As; do not rely on exact joined structure.
//
// # Validation vs read outcome
//
// Caller/input validation errors (e.g. negative start/size, invalid range) are
// returned as a non-nil error. Remote/read outcome errors (timeout, rejected,
// short read, etc.) are represented in ReadResult.Status and result.Err().
//
// # Options
//
// Options passed to New are immutable after construction.
//
// # Discovery and probing (connectionless helpers)
//
// Discover, ProbeRackSlots, and CompareRead are connectionless discovery/probe helpers,
// distinct from connected client operations (ReadArea, WriteArea, etc.). They create
// one or more TCP connections
// (Discover and ProbeRackSlots per host or per candidate; CompareRead per candidate).
// On large networks, use bounded CIDR ranges, timeouts, and parallelism options to
// avoid excessive connection churn. Safe defaults: limit discovery to /24 or smaller
// where possible, set WithDiscoverTimeout/WithTimeout, and use moderate Parallelism.
// SafetyMode (conservative/normal/aggressive), optional jitter, and max attempts per host
// are supported for ProbeRackSlots and Discover to reduce connection churn on sensitive OT networks.
//
// ProbeReadableRanges runs over a single client connection; probes are serialized.
// RangeProbeRequest.Parallelism is retained for API consistency but does not increase
// wire-level concurrency—only one probe runs at a time. Do not rely on it for throughput.
//
// # Retry and resilience
//
// Retry semantics differ by API: UploadBlock retries failed chunk reads (transient
// errors only; protocol/parse failures fail fast). Range probes support Retries and
// Repeat for stability. ReadArea, WriteArea, and CompareRead have no built-in retry;
// callers can wrap calls in their own backoff/retry if needed.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// Concurrent use is safe, but all protocol operations are serialized per client instance.
// Only one request or connection transition is in flight at a time; long operations
// (e.g. UploadBlock) block other reads and writes on that client. Typical use:
// Connect once, perform operations, then Close. Calling methods after Close may
// return ErrNotConnected or transport errors.
//
// # Reconnection
//
// Reconnecting after transport failure or intentional Close is supported: call
// Close() then Connect(ctx) again. The client does not auto-reconnect; callers
// must call Connect after Close to resume use.
//
// # Negotiated PDU size
//
// ConnectionInfo() is the canonical source for negotiated connection state; ConnectionInfo().PDUSize
// is the negotiated maximum S7 PDU payload length (bytes). PDUSize() is a shorthand for it.
// All request sizing and chunk planning use this value; sendReceive rejects any request whose
// S7 payload length exceeds it.
